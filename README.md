# Waypoint System

The draggable handles shows up when the waypoint system gameobject is selected. More handles can be added by adding more elements to the waypoint list.

The character which uses the waypoint system can cycle through all the points or walk in reverse order once reaching the end of all the waypoints. This is a toggleable setting in the inspector when selecting the character.

The changes on the handles are undoable and redoable.
